                        users. Whenever this Privacy Policy mentions
                        <strong>giving us consent</strong> or similar phrases, it refers to giving Ducky your consent. "Us" and "Ducky" are used interchangeably, and both mean the same thing in this context.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold heading mb-4">2. Using the Ducky website</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">We currently support 2 features on our website that collect and process information. This includes Discord login and Roblox login; these are both done through an OAuth2 flow. For Discord login, the website stores a cookie with the
                        provided authentication code from Discord. For Roblox login, the authentication code from Roblox is send to our API, which can link your Discord account with your Roblox account. More information about linking with Ducky can be
                        found in section 3.1. Our domain is managed by Cloudflare, which provides basic statistical information about traffic on our domain. For information about how Cloudflare handles data, please view their privacy policy (accessible
                        at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" class="text-[#F5FF82] hover:underline">https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy</a>).</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold heading mb-4">3. Using Ducky in Discord</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">When using Ducky in your Discord server, you give us consent to see and process information about your server and you Ducky has access to. Additionally, Ducky may store and use information you give it to make it do what it's supposed
                        to. Extra information on specific topics can be found below.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3.1. Roblox Linking
                    </h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">There are 2 ways you can get linked with Ducky. First is manually linking yourself. This can be done through the website or with the legacy verification method through a Discord command. The second possibility is when joining a server
                        that has the <strong>Use Bloxlink</strong> feature enabled. This will use the Bloxlink "private" API (which requires a server key and the user to be a member of the server) to see if you have Roblox information on Bloxlink. If
                        it does find Roblox information, it will DM you with confirmation and will not store the information from the Bloxlink API until you authorize this. If you don't want to receive this DM anymore, you can click the third option <strong>Deny, and don't ask
                                again</strong>. Ducky will store your preference in usersettings, which can be managed with the
                        <code>/usersettings</code> command. With that command you can also disable this feature in advance, and Ducky will not look up Roblox information using the Bloxlink API for you. Once linked with Ducky, using any way, anyone can
                        get your Roblox ID using your Discord ID and the other way around. You can unlink from Ducky at any time using the
                        <code>/link</code> command and clicking
                        <strong>Unlink</strong>.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">3.2. ER:LC API Key</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">When providing Ducky with an API key, you give us consent to see and process information about your ER:LC server. Ducky will automate requests to the PRC API, required for many of its features. Abiding by the PRC Private Server API

                        once Ducky is removed from your server, it will not make any requests to the PRC API using your API key. For information about data retention, including the retention of your ER:LC API key, see section 6.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold heading mb-4">4. Storage of Data</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">Ducky stores data in an SQL database stored on the VPS (Virtual Private Server) managed by Nuyek (<a href="https://nuyek.com" class="text-[#F5FF82] hover:underline">https://nuyek.com</a>). The raw data files are only accessible by
                        Ducky Senior Developers+, which currently include @bobbibones (Discord ID: 782235114858872854) and @troptopreal (Discord ID: 598958193032560642). Access to data through any Ducky service will ensure the user has the required authorization
                        to access that data. Ducky frequently makes a backup of the raw data file. Backups are deleted after 5 days, and are only used for disaster recovery. We do not sell your data. We may share it with trusted third parties only when
                        necessary to provide our services, comply with legal obligations, or protect our rights.
