        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

          >) applies to all interactions with the Bot. The User agrees to the

        </p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

          The Ducky team may modify or discontinue the Bot at any time without

        <h2>Ducky Plus+ | Terms & Conditions</h2>
        <h3>Agreement</h3>
        <p>
          By purchasing Ducky Plus+ through any payment method/form, the User
          agrees to these terms. If you are in the Ducky support server, and
          have claimed the Ducky Plus+ role (through a Ducky Plus+ ticket in the
          support channel), you will always be notified about changes in this
          section.
        </p>

        <h3>Subscription</h3>
        <p>
          At the moment, the User may only purchase Ducky Plus+ through
          <a href="https://roblox.com/games/120255327552791/Ducky-Plus"
            >the Roblox game</a
          >. For every Ducky Plus+ purchase the User makes, their personal
          subscription will be extended by 30 days. The User will receive 1
          slot, which can grant a server Ducky Plus+ until their personal
          subscription expires. This means if the User purchases Ducky Plus+ 2
          times, the User can grant 2 servers 2 months of Ducky Plus+. A slot
          cannot be used on a server that has an active subscription. If a slot
          is not used before the User's personal subscription expires, the slot
          cannot be used anymore.
        </p>

        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>
          All methods/forms of purchasing Ducky Plus+ are not refundable. The
          usage of a slot on a server may be refunded only if the server does
          not have data in our database which was granted by the slot. When a
          slot is refunded, the slot expires when the User's personal
          subscription expires.
        </p>

        <h3>Revokability</h3>
        <p>
          The Ducky team reserves the right to terminate a User‚Äôs access to
          Ducky Plus+ for any reason. Appeals can be made via a Support ticket
          in the Ducky Support server.
        </p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Bot and all intellectual property rights therein are and shall
          remain the property of the Ducky team. The User agrees not to copy,
          modify, or distribute the Bot or any portion thereof without the
          express written consent of the Ducky team.
        </p>

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          The User agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Ducky team, its
          affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and
          agents from any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and
          expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of the
          User's use of the Bot.
        </p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>
          This Agreement may be terminated by either party at any time for any
          reason. Upon termination, the User must immediately cease all use of
          the Bot.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          This Agreement and any disputes or claims arising out of or in
          connection with it, including but not limited to its formation,
          validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement, shall be
          governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United
          States. This choice of law applies regardless of any conflicts of law
          principles or rules that might otherwise apply the laws of another
          jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using Ducky, you agree that any legal actions or proceedings
          related to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive
          jurisdiction of the courts located within the United States.
        </p>

        <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
          and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or
          representations, whether written or oral, relating to the Bot.
